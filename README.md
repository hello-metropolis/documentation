# Hello Metropolis

Metropolis provides a hub for managing sandbox environments using  infrastructure-as-code.

It provides a web front-end, APIs and terraform plugins to allow the easy configuration, management and maintenance of these sandbox environments.

> If you're learning the Metropolis platform for the first time, review the [overview documentation](/overview) first, followed by the [quickstart](https://github.com/hello-metropolis/quickstart) guide.
>
> Once you understand the platform, the documentation below will help guide you in your implementation and configuration.
